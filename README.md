This is a simple python script which can be used to add multiple devices to SNMP Collector.

Please see the project homepage for more info on the excellent SNMP Collector:

This script has been made more as an example of how the API interface in SNMP Collector can be used.  It's stupidly basic but hopefully it may help others work out what they need to do.

To work out what the data formats to write to the API are you can do a packet capture while using the web GUI.  The JSON is easy to see in the HTTP packets for any particular element.

Please note project is developed to work under Python 3 only.
